"""Working with volumetric data"""


"""We've learned how to load and preent 2D images, like the
ones we take with a camera in some contexts, such as medical
imaging applications involving, say, CT (computed tomography)
scans, we typically deal with sequences of images stacked along
the headto-foot axis, each corresponding to a slice across the 
human body
